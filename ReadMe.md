# Practicing C++
This is to brush up on skills in the C++ language and develop good programming habits. The book that is being used to do this is **Programming Principles and Practice USing C++** by Bjarne Stroustrup. I will go through the book starting from chapter 2 as the first part of the book is for motivation to learn the language and explains why computers matter.
