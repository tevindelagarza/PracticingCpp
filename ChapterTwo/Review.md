**1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" program?**
The purpose of the "Hello, World!" program is to be able to write your first program to make sure everything such as the compiler was set-up correctly. It is the most basic program one can set-up.
**2. Name four parts of a function?**
1. A *return type*, for example, int which specificies what kind of result, if any, the function will return to whoever asked for it to be executed.
2. A *name*, here main.
3. A *parameter list* enclosed in parantheses, here (); in this case the parameter list is empty.
4. A *function body* enclosed in a set of "curly braces", {}, which lists the actions (called statements) that the function is to perform.

**3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.**
The *int main(){}* function must appear in every C++ program to tell where to start executing.

**4. In the "Hello, World!" program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?**
The purpose of the *return 0;* is that the program terminated successfully.

**5. What is the purpose of the compiler?**
The purpose of the compiler is to take the source code that was written and turn it into machine code/ object code for the computer to understand. The compiler is the programmers best friend.

**6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?**
The purpose of the #include is to instruct the computer to make available a library that has some code that can be access using declarations. A declaration is a program statement specifying how a piece of code can be used.

**7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?**
The .h means a header file. A header file contains definitions of terms and other pieces of code.

**8. What does the linker do for your program?**
A linker links the object code and the object code from the C++ standard library together and creates the executable.

**9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?**
A source file is the program that the programmer wrote to be compiled. Whereas, the object file what the computer executes as it is machine code after it has been through the compiler.

**10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?**
An IDE stands for an *interactive development environment* and it is an editor that includes many helpful features to start coding, debugging, and more.

**11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?**
It is necessary to practice to become a master. Textbook learning is great and gives the concepts and tools for one to start doing the thing. However, it does not make you good at the tools. It is a craft that needs to be done over and over again to become good at what is being done.
