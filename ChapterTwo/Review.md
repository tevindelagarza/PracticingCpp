**1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" program?**
The purpose of the "Hello, World!" program is to be able to write your first program to make sure everything such as the compiler was set-up correctly. It is the most basic program one can set-up.

**2. Name four parts of a function?**
1. A *return type*, for example, int which specificies what kind of result, if any, the function will return to whoever asked for it to be executed.
2. A *name*, here main.
3. A *parameter list* enclosed in parantheses, here (); in this case the parameter list is empty.
4. A *function body* enclosed in a set of "curly braces", {}, which lists the actions (called statements) that the function is to perform.
